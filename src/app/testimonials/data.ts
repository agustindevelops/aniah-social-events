      "I wish I had photos of the Halloween party but my first impression was completely blown away with her vision. She definitely has an eye for decoration and she was very organized in how each space had a designated area for different activities/purposes. Everyone had a great time!",

      "I can't recommend Aniah enough! Her assistance was invaluable throughout the entire event. Despite our plans for an outdoor ceremony, unexpected rain forced us to quickly switch gears to an indoor setup. Her quick thinking, professionalism, attention to detail, and calming presence ensured everything ran smoothly. Her suggestions and support made all the difference. Thank you for making our special day truly memorable.",

      "Aniah made our wedding day incredible and we honestly could not have done it without her. From the moment we spoke with her we felt at ease and her warm, bubbly personality was just what we needed during a stressful time! Aniah checked up on us regularly, we shared excel sheets, and she was always just a text message/phone call away. The day of we got to the venue and unloaded and she was ready to go! She was actually there before us and had already begun working with the staff there to make sure we had what we wanted. Throughout the day Aniah made on the fly decisions that worked out perfectly. Our day was wet and I'm sure chaotic at times, but we didn't feel any stress that day. We had the upmost faith and knew she was capable of making our day a success. We had a great time, ended up with all of our belongings loaded up at the end of the night without us having to lift a finger. We could not have done it without her and can't thank her enough for her help.",

      "I had the pleasure of working with Aniah for over a year. We could not have our non-traditional wedding without her - from unlimited tacos at a taco truck, karaoke on the street, coordinating my dog as our ring bearer, Aniah did all of this in the blink of an eye. Without being able to articulate my exact ideas, I gave Aniah the vision and she ran with it. Aniah lets you know from the beginning that you can put your trust in her as long as she vision is there. Aniah also helps show you what is already out there and will do the research for you. Many of the decisions were deferred to Aniah as she was 'the boss'. I had full faith in Aniah and she not only delivered but exceeded expectations. I hope to work with Aniah again one day. I would call Aniah a friend today (and sometimes therapist) üíñ",
